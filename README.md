# wordtrain #
## A command-line game I wrote for kids in C++ - needs C++ 11 or higher ##
### Computer and you take turns in playing a letter each. First player to complete a valid word (5 letter or longer) loses! ###

This README can guide you, step by step, if you want to:
* Download the code, compile and play the game
* Download and follow along a walk-through of the C++ code

#### Download the code, compile and play the game ####

1. My instructions are for Linux. On Windows, you can use an IDE like Visual Studio to compile and run the code; it might need some additional steps like setting of relative paths to find the word files for loading, using C++ 11 and STL libraries, etc.
2. On a Linux machine, clone this git repository
