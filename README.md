# wordtrain #
## A command-line game I wrote for kids in C++ (needs C++ 11 or higher) ##
### Computer and you take turns in playing a letter each. First player to complete a valid word (5 letters or longer) loses! ###

This README can guide you, step by step, if you want to:
* Download the code, compile and play the game
* Download and follow along a walk-through of the C++ code

#### Download the code, compile and play the game ####

1. My instructions are for Linux. On Windows, you can use an IDE like Visual Studio to compile and run the code; it might need some additional steps like setting of relative paths to find the word files for loading, using C++ 11 and STL libraries, etc.
2. On a Linux machine, clone this git repository
3. Make sure you can compile C++ with C++ 11 libraries installed
    1. On Debian derivatives like Ubuntu, this will help: `sudo apt-get install build-essential`
4. Navigate to the directory where you cloned this repository. if you list the files, you should see train.cpp and and subdirectory called wordsNOCR
5. Build the executable: `g++ -std=c++11 -o train train.cpp`
6. Run the executable: `./train`
7. Play, the instruction-set is self-explanatory, game play is easy
